# EqiupmentInfoExe
You can find source codes of the executable file that provides to bring equipment information quickly

I developed this exe 3 years ago. This is the third version of its.

Right now, I don't have authentication to run.  I'm sharing its source codes just to give you an idea about my developments. I've also added some screen shots to visualize their outputs. 

I wrote the code in Python and I use mainly the pandas libraries.
After that, to visualize and to have interactions with users, I turned these code into an  executable file with the power of PyQt5.
